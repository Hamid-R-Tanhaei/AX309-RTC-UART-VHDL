# ALINX-AX309-RTC-UART-VHDL
An example of driving RTC(Real time clock) and UART applying to Spartan6 Xilinx FPGA ALINX AX309. [Link_to_VHDL_code](Xilinx_ISE_project/Main.vhd). \
The Time is shown on the 6 7segments on the board. Also, the time (in HH:MM:SS format) is sent to the PC through UART connectivity provided 
on the board which is connected to PC via USB port. Use a utility like Termite on PC to show the time.
